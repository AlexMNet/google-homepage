This is the first front end project from The Odin Project. 

Its been a while since I have practiced css since I am primarily focued on backend programming. 

I have not refactored this to be clean. Currenlty just spaghettish code. Just wanted to do a quick css centered project and practice flex. 

I took a lot of styling information from inspecting the google homepage using developer tools.

The footer is responsive in a similar manner as google's homepage.

I added hover changes to all links and buttons.
